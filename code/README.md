# Pentoref automatic corpus exploration

Code for exploring the Pentoref data.

## Set up ##

Requires Python 3.7 (tested on 3.7.4)

Install the requirements using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Data exploration ##

Use the two notebooks for data exploration are as follows:

1. `PentoRef_Exploration_dataframes_1.ipynb` -- reads in data from raw data and stores it in pandas dataframes where all the normal pandas magic can be done.
2. `PentoRef_Exploration_sqlite_databases_1.ipynb` -- allows the creation and saving of sqlite databases from the derived data and some example queries on them. We do not upload the databases directly here in this repo due to the size.
